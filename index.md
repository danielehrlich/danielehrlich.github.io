## About Me

Welcome! I am a macroeconomics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago Department of Economics. I am broadly interested in growth and development, drawning on tools from **macroeconomics**, **trade**, and **finance**. My research is at the nexus of models and data, combining structural models with original surveys, big data, and a range of causal inference methods including RCTs.

I was a visiting scholar at the Columbia Business School from September 2023 to June 2024 and a visiting scholar at the MIT Department of Economics from January 2023 to May 2023.
