## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago Department of Economics. 
My research is broadly concerned with economic growth in developing countries, using tools from **macroeconomics**, **trade**, and **finance**. I am particularly interested in how intermediation in trade and financial markets affects the organization of firms, supply chains, and production.

I am a visiting scholar at the Columbia Business School from September 2023 to June 2024 and was a visiting scholar at MIT from January to June 2023.
