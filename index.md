## About Me

Welcome! I received my Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 2025. I was a visiting scholar at the Columbia Business School from September 2023 to June 2024 and a visiting scholar at the MIT Department of Economics from January 2023 to May 2023. My academic research is at the nexus of models and data, combining structural models with original surveys, big data, and a range of machine learning, causal inference, and experimental methods.
