## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago Department of Economics. 
My research is broadly concerned with economic growth in developing economics, using tools from **macroeconomics**, **trade**, and **finance**. I am particularly interested in how intermediation in financial and agricultural markets affects the organization of firms, supply chains, and production.
